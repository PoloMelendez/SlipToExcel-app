# SlipToExcel-app
A small application to convert a suppliers txt document packing slips into an excel worksheet, and apply it to an existing workbook.
A sample workbook, as well as a the template made to work with this application is provided. I've also added a sample packing slip,
with the prices set to a dummy value. The workbook and template will not often be changed in practice, so they are saved. The 
worksheet name is automatically set to the current date, but can be changed, to match the businesses practices. The average use
of the app will consist simply of selecting the new packing slip for the day.
